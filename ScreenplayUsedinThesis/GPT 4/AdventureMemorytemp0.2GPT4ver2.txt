INT. ANCIENT LIBRARY - NIGHT

The scene opens in a vast, shadow-filled room lined with towering shelves of ancient books. Dust particles dance in the beams of moonlight filtering through the stained glass windows. The air is thick with the musty smell of old paper and leather. In the center, a large wooden table is cluttered with maps, scrolls, and a flickering oil lamp.

We see ALICE, a young woman in her late twenties, with a determined look and dressed in a practical field outfit. She's poring over an old map, her brow furrowed in concentration. Her fingers trace a route that leads to a marked spot labeled "The Temple of the Forgotten."

ALICE
(whispering to herself)
This has to be it. The final piece of the puzzle.

Suddenly, the sound of footsteps echoes in the distance. Alice quickly hides the map under a pile of books and extinguishes the lamp. The room plunges into darkness. She crouches behind the table, her breath shallow.

The door creaks open, and a beam of light from a flashlight cuts through the darkness. A tall, imposing figure steps in - MR. HAWTHORNE, a rival archaeologist in his fifties, rugged and untrustworthy.

MR. HAWTHORNE
(calling out)
I know you're in here, Alice. You might as well come out.

Alice remains silent, her hand gripping a small dagger hidden in her boot.

MR. HAWTHORNE
(smirking)
You can't hide forever. And you can't run with what I need.

Alice calculates her next move, then stands up slowly, revealing herself but keeping the table between them.

ALICE
(trying to sound confident)
What do you want, Hawthorne?

MR. HAWTHORNE
(stepping closer, flashlight aimed at her)
The map, Alice. Hand it over, and I might let you walk out of here.

Alice's eyes dart around, looking for an escape route. She spots a rope attached to one of the large chandeliers.

ALICE
You know I can't do that.

MR. HAWTHORNE
Then I guess we'll have to do this the hard way.

As he steps forward, Alice suddenly throws a book at him, momentarily distracting him. She leaps onto the table, runs across it, and jumps, grabbing the rope. She swings across the room as Hawthorne fires a shot, missing her by inches.

Alice lands gracefully on the other side, near the exit. She looks back at Hawthorne with a defiant glare.

ALICE
(shouting)
You'll never get the map, Hawthorne!

She dashes out of the room, leaving Hawthorne fuming in frustration.

CUT TO:

EXT. ANCIENT LIBRARY - NIGHT

Alice emerges from the library into the cool night air, her heart racing. She looks back at the towering silhouette of the library, then sets off into the darkness, determined to reach the Temple of the Forgotten before Hawthorne can catch up.

EXT. DENSE JUNGLE - NIGHT

The moon casts a silvery glow over the thick, tangled undergrowth of the jungle. The sounds of nocturnal creatures fill the air, creating a symphony of chirps, howls, and rustles. Alice, her face streaked with sweat and dirt, pushes through the dense foliage with determination. Her map, now slightly crumpled, is clutched tightly in her hand.

Suddenly, she stops, hearing the distant roar of water. She consults her map under the light of her flashlight, confirming her suspicions. A river should be nearby, and according to the map, a hidden cave behind the waterfall holds the next clue to the Temple of the Forgotten.

As Alice makes her way toward the sound, the vegetation becomes denser, and the terrain, more treacherous. She slips on a wet rock but catches herself just in time, her breath quickening with the close call.

Finally, the dense jungle opens up to reveal a magnificent waterfall cascading down a rocky cliff. The moonlight illuminates the water, creating a mesmerizing effect. Alice approaches cautiously, scanning the area for any signs of Hawthorne or his men.

She finds a narrow path behind the waterfall and follows it. The roar of the water is deafening as she slips through the narrow opening in the rock face.

INT. HIDDEN CAVE BEHIND WATERFALL - NIGHT

Inside, the cave is damp and echoey. Stalactites and stalagmites glisten in the light of Alice's flashlight. She moves deeper into the cave, her footsteps cautious on the slippery rock.

At the far end of the cave, she discovers a stone pedestal. On it rests an ancient, dust-covered book bound in leather. Alice approaches it reverently, her hands trembling slightly as she reaches out to brush the dust away.

ALICE
(whispering)
This has to be it. The Chronicle of the Ancients.

She carefully opens the book, the pages crackling with age. The text is in a language she doesn't fully understand, but she recognizes some of the symbols from her studies. She takes out her notebook and begins to make translations, completely absorbed in her task.

Suddenly, a noise at the entrance of the cave snaps her back to reality. She quickly hides the book under her jacket and extinguishes her flashlight, plunging the cave into darkness. Her heart pounds as she presses herself against the cave wall, barely daring to breathe.

A beam of light sweeps through the cave as two of Hawthorne's men enter, their voices echoing off the walls.

HENCHMAN 1
(whispering)
Check over there. She's got to be here somewhere.

HENCHMAN 2
(grumbling)
This wild goose chase is getting old. What does Hawthorne even want with this old junk?

They split up, their flashlights bobbing in different directions. Alice waits for her moment, then silently moves towards the entrance, staying in the shadows.

As she nears the exit, the first henchman turns, almost spotting her. She freezes, holding her breath. After a tense moment, he turns away, and she makes a run for it, slipping out of the cave and back into the jungle.

EXT. JUNGLE NEAR WATERFALL - NIGHT

Once outside, Alice doesn't stop to look back. She runs as fast as she can, the Chronicle of the Ancients secure under her jacket, her mind racing with the translations she has just uncovered. She knows she must reach the Temple of the Forgotten before dawn, or all could be lost.

EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAWN

The first light of dawn filters through the dense canopy, casting a soft glow over the jungle. Alice, exhausted but determined, emerges into a small clearing. She pauses to catch her breath, leaning against a tree. Her clothes are torn and muddy, evidence of her harrowing night. She pulls out the Chronicle of the Ancients from under her jacket, checking to ensure it’s still intact.

Alice opens her map once more, tracing the route with her finger. She’s close now, very close to the Temple of the Forgotten. The anticipation fuels her tired body with a burst of energy. She takes a deep breath, steeling herself for the final leg of her journey, and sets off again.

EXT. ANCIENT STONE BRIDGE - MORNING

The jungle gives way to a wider river, spanned by an ancient stone bridge covered in moss and vines. The craftsmanship suggests it could be centuries old, possibly built by the same civilization that constructed the temple. Alice approaches cautiously, aware of the bridge's age and the possibility it might not hold her weight.

She steps onto the bridge, testing each stone before putting her full weight on it. Halfway across, she hears a rustle from the bushes nearby. Instantly on alert, she crouches, scanning the surroundings.

MR. HAWTHORNE
(O.S.)
No need to be so jumpy, Alice.

Alice whirls around to see Mr. Hawthorne stepping out onto the bridge. He looks disheveled, his clothes torn from his own passage through the jungle. Despite his appearance, his eyes gleam with a mix of admiration and greed.

ALICE
(keeping her voice steady)
What do you want, Hawthorne?

MR. HAWTHORNE
Walking across an ancient bridge like old friends, discussing history, perhaps?

Alice doesn’t lower her guard, aware that any wrong move could send her plummeting into the river below.

ALICE
Why are you following me? What do you really want?

MR. HAWTHORNE
(grinning)
Isn’t it obvious? I want the Chronicle. And whatever treasures lie in the temple.

Alice edges away, but Hawthorne matches her steps, keeping the distance between them constant.

ALICE
You won’t get it.

MR. HAWTHORNE
(suddenly serious)
Oh, but I think I will. See, unlike you, I’m not here for the thrill of discovery. I’m here for profit. And I’m not above sharing... for the right price.

Alice sees her chance. She suddenly lunges forward, feinting a handover of the book. As Hawthorne reaches out, she sidesteps, pushing him off balance. He stumbles, but grabs her arm, pulling her towards the edge.

They struggle, teetering dangerously close to the edge. Alice, with a desperate effort, manages to break free of his grip. Hawthorne loses his footing and falls back, but catches himself at the last second, clinging to the side of the bridge.

ALICE
(looking down at him, conflicted)
I could leave you here.

MR. HAWTHORNE
(pleading)
Help me, Alice. Please.

After a tense moment, Alice sighs and extends her hand. Hawthorne grabs it, and she pulls him up. Once he’s safely on the bridge, he nods at her, a grudging respect in his eyes.

MR. HAWTHORNE
(brushing himself off)
Not many would have done that.

ALICE
Just keep your distance, Hawthorne.

With a wary glance at Hawthorne, Alice turns and continues across the bridge. Hawthorne watches her go, a calculating look on his face.

EXT. TEMPLE OF THE FORGOTTEN - MORNING

The jungle opens up to reveal the Temple of the Forgotten. It rises majestically against the morning sky, its stone walls covered in intricate carvings and moss. Alice steps into the clearing, her eyes wide with awe and reverence. She approaches the temple, her steps echoing in the silent air.

ALICE
(to herself)
This is it. All the answers are here.

She reaches out to touch the cool stone, feeling the weight of history under her fingertips. The journey has been long, but she is finally here, ready to uncover the secrets that have been lost to time.

CUT TO:

Alice steps into the shadow of the temple, the Chronicle of the Ancients clutched tightly in her hand, ready to face whatever mysteries lie within.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE FORGOTTEN - MAIN CHAMBER - MORNING

The interior of the temple is cool and dim, the air thick with the scent of earth and age. Sunlight streams through cracks in the stone, illuminating the chamber with beams of light that reveal intricate hieroglyphs and carvings on the walls. Alice steps cautiously inside, her flashlight sweeping over the ancient symbols, her face a mask of concentration and awe.

She approaches a large altar at the center of the chamber, upon which rests a stone tablet covered in more inscriptions. She sets down the Chronicle of the Ancients beside the tablet and begins to compare the symbols in the book with those on the stone.

ALICE
(muttering to herself)
These symbols... they match. This could be the key to unlocking the temple’s secrets.

As she studies the tablet, a low rumbling sound begins to fill the chamber. Dust falls from the ceiling as the ground shakes slightly. Alice looks around, alarmed.

ALICE
(whispering)
What’s happening?

The rumbling stops as suddenly as it started, leaving a heavy silence. Alice, though unnerved, turns her attention back to the tablet. She traces her fingers over the symbols, her expression one of deep focus.

Suddenly, a hidden compartment in the altar opens with a soft click. Alice gasps, stepping back as a small, ornate box made of stone and encrusted with gems slowly emerges from within the altar. She reaches out tentatively and lifts the box, examining it closely.

ALICE
(in awe)
Incredible. The ancients were full of surprises.

She carefully opens the box. Inside, wrapped in a faded cloth, is a small golden idol, depicting a deity worshipped by the ancient civilization. Alice carefully unwraps the idol, her hands trembling slightly with the magnitude of her find.

ALICE
(softly)
This must be the deity of wisdom and protection... mentioned in the Chronicle.

She gently sets the idol on the altar, standing back to take in the sight. Her moment of reverence is interrupted by the sound of footsteps echoing through the chamber. She spins around, flashlight in hand, to see Mr. Hawthorne entering the chamber, his expression a mix of frustration and determination.

MR. HAWTHORNE
Breathless, he says,
I must admit, Alice, you are full of surprises. But you can’t keep this discovery to yourself.

ALICE
(defiantly)
This belongs to history, Hawthorne, not to the highest bidder.

MR. HAWTHORNE
(smirking)
We’ll see about that.

Hawthorne takes a step forward, but Alice is quicker. She grabs the idol and dashes towards a narrow passageway at the back of the chamber. Hawthorne curses and follows.

INT. TEMPLE PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

The passageway is narrow and lined with more carvings. Alice’s footsteps echo as she races through, clutching the idol. Behind her, Hawthorne’s heavier steps grow louder. Alice glances back, sees him gaining on her, and pushes herself to run faster.

The passageway suddenly opens into a smaller room filled with ancient artifacts and pottery. Alice skids to a stop, looking for another exit. She spots a small crawl space partially hidden behind a fallen column.

As Hawthorne enters the room, Alice squeezes into the crawl space, dragging herself forward with determination. Hawthorne reaches the spot just as she disappears into the darkness.

MR. HAWTHORNE
(shouting)
You can’t hide forever, Alice!

INT. SECRET CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

Alice emerges from the crawl space into a secret chamber, her body covered in dust and sweat. She takes a moment to catch her breath, then looks around. The chamber is filled with relics and offerings, a treasure trove untouched by time.

ALICE
(breathing heavily)
This... this is the heart of the temple.

She sets the idol down on a stone pedestal that seems made for it. As soon as the idol touches the pedestal, a mechanism triggers, and the walls of the chamber begin to shift, revealing yet another hidden compartment containing a large, beautifully illustrated manuscript.

ALICE
(amazed)
The lost teachings...

She approaches the manuscript, her eyes wide with wonder and excitement. This discovery could change everything. But first, she needs to get out of the temple safely, with both the idol and the manuscript.

ALICE
(to herself)
Time to end this chase, once and for all.

Determined, Alice gathers the manuscript and idol, preparing to navigate her way back through the temple’s labyrinthine passageways, knowing that Hawthorne won’t be far behind.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE FORGOTTEN - SECRET CHAMBER - DAY

Alice carefully wraps the manuscript and the golden idol in her sturdy canvas bag, ensuring their protection. She takes a deep breath, steeling herself for the journey back through the temple's complex network of passageways. The weight of her discovery presses upon her, both physically and metaphorically, as she prepares to confront whatever challenges lie ahead.

She exits the secret chamber, retracing her steps with the map of the temple etched in her memory. Her flashlight pierces the darkness, casting long shadows on the ancient walls.

INT. TEMPLE PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Alice moves swiftly but cautiously, her senses heightened for any sign of Hawthorne or his men. As she rounds a corner, she hears voices echoing through the stone corridors. She presses herself against the wall, listening.

HENCHMAN 1
(O.S.)
(whispering)
Check every corner. Hawthorne wants the artifacts, and he wants the girl captured. No slip-ups.

HENCHMAN 2
(O.S.)
(grumbling)
This place is a maze. She could be anywhere.

Alice waits until their footsteps fade before continuing. Her heart races as she navigates the dimly lit passageways, her mind racing with strategies to evade Hawthorne's relentless pursuit.

INT. TEMPLE - MAIN HALL - DAY

Alice emerges into the main hall, where the morning light now streams through the open doorway, casting brilliant patterns on the floor. She pauses, considering her options, then spots a series of small alcoves along the walls. She moves to one and carefully sets her bag inside, covering it with some debris to camouflage it.

ALICE
(to herself)
Just in case I don’t make it out. Someone else might finish what I started.

Suddenly, a shadow falls across the entrance. Alice tenses, ready to flee, but then relaxes as a familiar figure steps into the light.

JACKSON, a fellow archaeologist and old friend, enters. He’s in his early thirties, rugged and quick-witted, with a trustworthy demeanor. He looks relieved to see her.

JACKSON
(grinning)
Looking for this?

He holds up a radio transmitter. Alice rushes to him, a smile breaking across her face.

ALICE
(relieved)
Jackson! How did you find me?

JACKSON
I’ve been tracking Hawthorne. Knew he was onto something big. And where there’s Hawthorne, there’s usually Alice, digging up the real treasure.

They share a quick, warm hug.

ALICE
(urgently)
We need to get out of here. Hawthorne’s close behind, and he’s not alone.

JACKSON
(nodding)
I saw his men. I’ve got a plan, but we need to move—now.

Alice leads Jackson to the alcove, retrieving her bag. Together, they head towards a less frequented exit Jackson had spotted earlier.

EXT. TEMPLE OF THE FORGOTTEN - SURROUNDING JUNGLE - DAY

Alice and Jackson emerge from the temple into the bright sunlight. The jungle around them is alive with the sounds of wildlife, a stark contrast to the silent stone corridors they’ve left behind.

JACKSON
(pointing)
There’s a village about half a day’s trek from here. We can get help there.

ALICE
(looking back at the temple)
And the artifacts?

JACKSON
We’ll come back for them. With a team. Right now, we need to focus on keeping you—and your discovery—safe.

Alice nods, the weight of responsibility clear in her eyes. They set off into the jungle, the dense foliage closing around them as they make their way towards safety.

As they disappear into the greenery, the camera pans back to reveal the majestic Temple of the Forgotten standing silently, its secrets once again hidden, waiting for the next chapter of its discovery.

CUT TO:

Alice and Jackson, their figures small against the vast jungle, continue their trek, their conversation a blend of planning and reflective thoughts on what the future holds for them and the incredible discoveries they've made.

EXT. DENSE JUNGLE - DAY

Alice and Jackson trek through the thick jungle underbrush, their pace brisk as they navigate the tangled roots and vines. The air is humid, filled with the sounds of distant animal calls and the rustle of leaves. They are alert, constantly scanning their surroundings for any signs of Hawthorne's men.

JACKSON
(adjusting his backpack)
We should reach the river soon. It’ll be easier to follow the water to the village.

ALICE
(checking her compass)
Right. And it’s less likely we’ll run into Hawthorne’s men along the river. They’ll expect us to head straight for the village.

They continue in silence for a moment, each lost in thought. Alice’s mind is on the manuscript and idol, the weight of their significance heavy on her shoulders.

ALICE
(softly, more to herself)
We need to ensure these artifacts make it to the right hands. The knowledge they hold could change everything we know about this ancient civilization.

JACKSON
(nodding)
And we will. But first, we need to get you out of here safely. You’ve made one hell of a discovery, Alice.

Their conversation is cut short by the sound of rushing water. They pick up their pace, pushing through the last bit of dense foliage to find themselves at the edge of a wide river. The water is clear and fast-moving.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

Alice and Jackson approach the river, relief visible on their faces. The riverbank offers a clear path forward, and the water provides a natural barrier from any potential pursuit from behind.

JACKSON
(pointing downstream)
There’s a crossing about a mile down. It’s mostly used by locals, so it should be safe.

ALICE
Let’s keep our guard up, just in case.

They start walking along the riverbank, the terrain here less challenging. The sound of the water is soothing, and for a moment, the danger they are in seems far away.

EXT. RIVER CROSSING - DAY

As they approach the crossing, a simple bridge made of ropes and wooden planks, Alice spots something unusual. She holds up her hand, signaling Jackson to stop.

ALICE
(whispering)
Look.

On the other side of the river, a group of local villagers are gathered. Among them, surprisingly, is an elderly man dressed in the traditional garb of the local tribe, speaking animatedly with the villagers.

JACKSON
(confused)
What’s going on?

ALICE
I’m not sure. But it might be our chance to blend in and get some help.

They carefully cross the bridge, approaching the group. As they get closer, the elderly man turns to them, his expression one of curiosity and caution.

ELDERLY MAN
(in the local dialect, subtitled)
Who are you? Why have you come here?

Alice steps forward, her expression earnest.

ALICE
(in the local dialect, subtitled)
We mean no harm. We’re researchers, and we need help. We have discovered something very important and need to ensure it reaches the right people.

The elderly man studies them for a moment, then nods slowly.

ELDERLY MAN
(subtitled)
You are in danger. We have seen men, armed and searching. Come, you must speak with our chief.

INT. VILLAGE CHIEF’S HOUSE - DAY

The chief’s house is spacious and cool, decorated with various artifacts and symbols of the tribe’s heritage. The chief, a robust woman in her sixties, listens intently as Alice and Jackson explain their situation and the significance of their discovery.

CHIEF
(subtitled)
The artifacts you speak of are sacred to our people as well. It is foretold that their return would bring enlightenment and prosperity.

ALICE
(subtitled)
Then we are more committed than ever to ensuring they are protected and studied respectfully.

The chief nods, her expression resolute.

CHIEF
(subtitled)
We will help you. But you must be cautious. The men who pursue you are dangerous and do not respect our ways or the relics of the past.

Alice and Jackson exchange a relieved glance. With the support of the village, their chances of safeguarding the artifacts—and themselves—have significantly improved.

CHIEF
(subtitled)
Rest now. We will plan more on the morrow.

As night falls, Alice and Jackson are given a place to sleep within the village, their minds at ease for the first time since their escape. Outside, the sounds of the jungle continue, a reminder of the wild and unpredictable world they navigate.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN

The first light of dawn casts a golden hue over the village. Roosters crow and the village slowly comes to life with the sounds of morning activity. Alice and Jackson emerge from the hut they were given for the night, looking refreshed but alert. The Chief approaches them, accompanied by two village elders, their faces marked with the wisdom of years.

CHIEF
(subtitled)
Today, we plan. You are safe here, but we must consider your next steps carefully.

ALICE
(subtitled)
Thank you, Chief. We appreciate all your help.

JACKSON
(subtitled)
Yes, thank you. We need to get these artifacts to a secure location where they can be studied and preserved.

The Chief nods, gesturing for them to follow her to a larger communal area where a map is spread out on a table. Villagers gather around, curious and eager to assist.

INT. VILLAGE COMMUNAL HUT - DAY

The hut is spacious, the walls adorned with tribal paintings and woven fabrics. The map on the table is detailed, showing the surrounding jungle, rivers, and paths, as well as nearby towns and cities.

CHIEF
(pointing to the map, subtitled)
There are several routes you can take. The quickest path to safety is through the jungle to the east, leading to a town with a research facility.

ELDER 1
(subtitled)
However, that path is often patrolled by those who seek to exploit our lands. It could be dangerous.

ELDER 2
(subtitled)
There is another way, longer and more arduous, through the mountains to the north. It is less traveled and might offer you more cover.

Alice and Jackson study the map, weighing their options. Alice’s finger traces the mountain path, her expression thoughtful.

ALICE
(subtitled)
The longer path might give us the advantage we need. We can avoid Hawthorne’s men and ensure the safety of the artifacts.

JACKSON
(subtitled)
It’s settled then. We’ll take the mountain path.

The villagers nod in agreement, and preparations begin. Some villagers offer to guide them part of the way, while others gather supplies for the journey.

EXT. VILLAGE - LATER THAT DAY

Alice and Jackson, now equipped with backpacks and walking sticks, are ready to depart. The villagers who have volunteered to guide them are also prepared, carrying machetes to clear the path and ropes for difficult terrain.

CHIEF
(subtitled)
May the spirits of the forest protect you on your journey.

ALICE
(subtitled)
Thank you, Chief. For everything.

The group sets off, leaving the village behind. The villagers wave goodbye, their faces a mixture of hope and concern.

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

The journey through the jungle is tough. The canopy is thick, filtering the sunlight into a perpetual twilight. The sounds of the jungle are all around them—birds calling, insects buzzing, and the occasional distant roar of an animal.

The guides are skilled, moving with ease through the dense undergrowth, occasionally stopping to point out medicinal plants or sources of fresh water. Alice and Jackson follow closely, their senses heightened, aware of the importance of every step they take.

As they ascend into the mountains, the terrain becomes even more challenging. The paths are narrow and steep, and they often have to use ropes to navigate rocky outcrops.

EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - EVENING

The sun begins to set, casting long shadows across the mountain path. The group decides to make camp for the night. They find a small clearing near a stream, the sound of water a comforting presence.

As they set up camp, Alice takes a moment to look back the way they came. The jungle stretches out below them, vast and mysterious. She then looks ahead, up the mountain path that disappears into the fading light.

ALICE
(to Jackson)
We’ve made it this far. We’ll keep going, no matter what.

JACKSON
(nodding)
Together.

They join the others around the campfire, sharing food and stories under the stars. Despite the dangers ahead, there is a sense of camaraderie and hope among them. As the fire crackles, the night envelops them, a temporary respite from the challenges of the day and those yet to come.

EXT. MOUNTAIN CAMP - EARLY MORNING

The first light of dawn breaks over the mountain, casting a soft glow on the campsite. The group stirs awake, the chill of the high altitude nipping at their skin. Alice and Jackson, wrapped in their blankets, share a quiet moment, watching the sunrise.

JACKSON
(whispering)
Every day on this journey brings something new. It’s hard, but... look at that view.

ALICE
(smiling)
It’s beautiful. Makes you realize how small our problems are in the grand scheme of things.

They pack up their camp, dousing the fire and securing their gear. The mountain guides gather the group for a quick briefing.

GUIDE 1
(subtitled)
Today, we climb higher. The path will be steep and the air thinner. Keep close and watch your step.

The group nods, mentally preparing for the day’s challenges. They set off as the sun fully rises, casting long shadows behind them.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY

The trail becomes increasingly treacherous. The narrow path skirts sheer drops, and loose stones make footing uncertain. The group relies heavily on their guides, who expertly navigate the difficult terrain.

Alice, her backpack secured tightly, follows closely behind one of the guides. Her eyes are focused on the path, but her mind wanders to the artifacts in her bag, their importance weighing heavily on her.

ALICE
(to herself)
Just a little further. Keep going.

Suddenly, a cry of alarm sounds from the front of the line. The group halts abruptly. Ahead, a small landslide has blocked the path, large rocks and debris making it impassable.

GUIDE 2
(subtitled)
We must find another way around. This could take some time.

The group backtracks to a small clearing where they assess their options. The guides confer, pointing to a barely visible trail that leads up a steep incline.

GUIDE 1
(subtitled)
It’s an old hunting path. It’s more dangerous, but it’s the only way.

JACKSON
(looking at Alice)
What do you think?

ALICE
(determined)
We’ve come this far. We can’t turn back now.

The group agrees to take the hunting path. They start the climb, the incline steep and the vegetation thick. Every step requires effort, and they frequently have to help each other over obstacles.

EXT. STEEP INCLINE - DAY

Halfway up the incline, the path narrows even further. Alice, leading at this point, stops suddenly, causing Jackson to bump into her.

JACKSON
(concerned)
What’s wrong?

Alice points ahead. Through the trees, they can see a figure watching them. It’s too far to make out details, but the presence of someone else is unsettling.

ALICE
(whispering)
Someone’s up there. Watching us.

The group tightens, the guides readying their machetes. Tension mounts as they slowly approach the spot where Alice saw the figure. As they reach it, they find nothing but a few disturbed leaves and a sense of unease.

GUIDE 2
(subtitled)
Could be a hunter. Or...

He doesn’t finish, but they all know the implication. Hawthorne’s men could be anywhere.

The group moves on, now even more cautious. The incident has rattled them, but it also strengthens their resolve.

EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON

After hours of grueling climb, the group finally reaches the ridge. The view is breathtaking, overlooking vast stretches of jungle and mountains. They take a moment to rest and take in the scenery.

ALICE
(looking out over the view)
We’re doing the right thing. I know it.

JACKSON
(sitting beside her)
We are. And we’re going to make it, Alice. Together.

The group sets up a temporary camp on the ridge, knowing they need to conserve their energy for the descent on the morrow. As the sun sets, casting the mountains in a golden light, there’s a shared feeling of accomplishment but also the unspoken anxiety about what lies ahead.

That night, under the stars, the group shares stories of their lives back home, their hopes, and fears. Despite the danger, there’s a bond forming, forged by shared adversity and the common goal of protecting something greater than themselves.

As they settle down for the night, Alice looks up at the stars, feeling a mix of fear and awe. The journey is far from over, but for now, they have the stars to guide them and the resolve to face whatever comes their way.

EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE CAMP - DAWN

The first light of dawn creeps over the horizon, casting a pale blue light over the campsite. The group is already stirring, the cold mountain air making everyone eager to get moving and warm up. Alice and Jackson, wrapped in their jackets, share a quick breakfast of energy bars and dried fruit with the group.

JACKSON
(looking out over the path ahead)
Today’s descent will be tricky. We need to stay sharp.

ALICE
(nodding)
Let’s make sure everyone sticks together. No one goes off the path.

The guides agree, and after a quick check of their gear, the group begins the descent. The path down the mountain is even steeper than the ascent, with loose gravel and sharp turns.

EXT. MOUNTAIN DESCENT - MORNING

The group moves cautiously, their boots sliding on the loose stones. The guides use ropes to secure steeper sections, ensuring everyone can get down safely. The tension is palpable; every step is a potential slip waiting to happen.

Halfway down, the group stops to rest by a small stream. The water is cold and refreshing, a welcome relief from the exertion. As they refill their water bottles, Alice notices a colorful bird perched nearby, watching them curiously.

ALICE
(smiling)
Even up here, life finds a way. It’s beautiful.

JACKSON
(joining her)
It’s a good reminder of why we do this. Not just for the artifacts, but for places like this. Untouched, wild.

Their moment of reflection is suddenly interrupted by a rustling in the bushes. The group tenses, hands going to their tools and weapons. One of the guides steps forward, machete ready.

GUIDE 1
(subtitled)
Stay back. Let me check.

He cautiously approaches the bush, peering into the foliage. After a tense moment, he relaxes and steps back, a small laugh escaping him.

GUIDE 1
(subtitled)
It’s just a mountain goat. Nothing to worry about.

The group laughs, the tension breaking. They finish their break and continue the descent, now slightly more relaxed but still vigilant.

EXT. LOWER MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NOON

As they reach the lower trails, the vegetation changes, becoming denser and more vibrant. The sound of a distant waterfall reaches their ears, a sign that they are nearing the base of the mountain.

Suddenly, Alice stops, her gaze fixed on something off the path. She bends down, examining the ground.

ALICE
(pointing)
Look, these aren’t animal tracks. They’re boot prints... and they’re fresh.

The group gathers around, the mood shifting instantly. Jackson examines the tracks, his brow furrowed.

JACKSON
(seriously)
They could be Hawthorne’s men. We need to be careful. Let’s pick up the pace and try to stay off the main path as much as possible.

The group quickens their pace, moving with renewed urgency. They use the denser foliage to their advantage, keeping to the shadows as much as possible.

EXT. MOUNTAIN BASE - LATE AFTERNOON

The group finally emerges from the mountain trails into a large clearing. The waterfall cascades down nearby, its roar a constant background noise. They pause, catching their breath, the relief of having made it down safely palpable.

However, their relief is short-lived. From the trees across the clearing, a group of armed men step out, blocking their path. The leader, a rugged man with a scar across his face, steps forward. It’s clear they are not friendly.

SCARRED MAN
(coldly)
You’ve been quite difficult to track, Miss Alice. But here you are, and with the artifacts, no doubt.

Alice steps forward, her expression calm but her heart racing.

ALICE
(bravely)
These artifacts belong to history. They’re not for sale or for use in your games.

SCARRED MAN
(smirking)
Everything has a price, Miss Alice. Let’s not make this harder than it needs to be.

Jackson steps beside Alice, his stance protective. The group tightens, ready to defend themselves if necessary.

JACKSON
(defiantly)
We’re not handing anything over. You’ll have to go through us.

The standoff intensifies, both groups aware that the next few moments could lead to violence. The sound of the waterfall drowns out everything else, a stark contrast to the tension in the clearing.

As both sides prepare for what comes next, Alice looks around, her mind racing for a solution that could avoid bloodshed. The artifacts, and their lives, hang in the balance.

EXT. MOUNTAIN BASE CLEARING - LATE AFTERNOON

The tense standoff continues, with both groups eyeing each other warily. The roar of the waterfall nearby is almost deafening, adding to the chaotic atmosphere. Alice and Jackson stand firm, surrounded by their group and the mountain guides, facing the Scarred Man and his armed mercenaries.

Suddenly, one of the mountain guides, an elderly man with deep knowledge of the terrain, whispers urgently to Alice.

MOUNTAIN GUIDE
(subtitled, urgent)
There is a narrow passage hidden by the waterfall. It can lead us down to the river path, but we must move swiftly and quietly.

Alice nods, understanding the risk but seeing no better option. She turns to Jackson and communicates the plan with a subtle gesture. Jackson nods, ready to support her decision.

ALICE
(to Scarred Man, loudly)
You want the artifacts? Come and get them!

Using her declaration as a distraction, Alice throws a small rock to the side, creating a noise that draws the mercenaries' attention. Seizing the moment, the group quickly but quietly starts moving towards the waterfall, led by the guide.

EXT. BEHIND THE WATERFALL - LATE AFTERNOON

The group rushes behind the cascading water, the spray soaking them as they slip through the narrow passage barely visible behind the veil of water. The path is slippery and treacherous, but the urgency of escape lends them agility. The sound of the waterfall muffles their movements, providing a natural cover.

Once they are all through, the guide points down a steep, rocky path that zigzags toward the river below. The group descends rapidly, helping each other over the difficult parts, their hearts pounding not just from the exertion but also from the fear of being followed.

EXT. RIVER PATH - LATE AFTERNOON

The group emerges at the river, breathing heavily but relieved to have put some distance between themselves and the mercenaries. They quickly move along the riverbank, using the dense foliage as cover. Alice checks behind them frequently, her eyes searching for any sign of pursuit.

JACKSON
(keeping pace with Alice)
That was too close. We need a better plan if they catch up.

ALICE
(agitated)
I know. But our options are limited. We need to keep moving and stay off the main paths.

As they continue, the guide suddenly motions for them to stop and points to a small, camouflaged boat hidden among the reeds. 

MOUNTAIN GUIDE
(subtitled)
We can use this to move faster and cover our tracks.

The group quickly but cautiously boards the small boat, their movements swift and silent. The guide takes the oars, and they start moving downstream, the current aiding their escape.

EXT. ON THE RIVER - EVENING

The boat glides quietly down the river, the dense jungle on either side providing a natural barrier. The light begins to fade, casting long shadows over the water, making it harder to spot the boat from the shore.

Alice sits close to Jackson, her mind racing with the day's events and the uncertainty ahead.

ALICE
(whispering)
We need to get these artifacts to a safe place. But where? Everywhere we go, danger follows.

JACKSON
(whispering back)
We'll find a way. We always do. Right now, let's focus on getting out of here alive.

As night falls, the guide steers the boat to a small, secluded inlet, well-hidden by overhanging trees. They decide to camp there for the night, taking turns keeping watch.

EXT. SECLUDED INLET - NIGHT

The group settles in, their bodies exhausted but minds alert. Alice takes the first watch, sitting by the boat, her gaze fixed on the dark jungle around them. The sounds of the night are both calming and eerie, a reminder of the wildness of their surroundings.

As she watches, Alice reflects on her journey, the weight of her responsibility, and the lives that now depend on her decisions. She feels the burden, but also a fierce determination to succeed, to protect the ancient secrets that have been entrusted to her.

The night passes slowly, with every rustle and splash magnifying their tension. But for now, they are safe, hidden away under the canopy of the jungle, the river their temporary ally in the relentless pursuit of survival and preservation.

As dawn approaches, Alice wakes Jackson for his turn at watch, her eyes weary but her resolve unbroken. They are far from out of danger, but for now, they have survived another night, and that is a victory in itself.

EXT. SECLUDED INLET - DAWN

The first light of dawn filters through the dense jungle canopy, casting a soft glow on the secluded inlet where the group has spent the night. The sounds of the jungle waking up fill the air, a symphony of birds and distant animal calls. Jackson is on watch, his eyes scanning the surrounding area for any signs of danger.

As the rest of the group begins to stir, the mountain guide quietly confers with Alice and Jackson, pointing downstream.

MOUNTAIN GUIDE
(subtitled)
We should reach the old mining town by midday if we keep a steady pace. It’s abandoned but we can use it to resupply and plan our next move.

ALICE
(nodding)
Good. We’ll need to be quick and keep a low profile. We can’t afford any more surprises.

The group quickly dismantles their makeshift camp, leaving no trace of their presence. They reload the boat and push off from the inlet, the guide steering them carefully down the river.

EXT. RIVER - MORNING

The boat moves swiftly with the current, the jungle on either side a blur of green. The group remains silent, the tension of their situation hanging over them like a cloud. Alice checks the map, her finger tracing their route as they navigate through the winding river.

Suddenly, a sharp noise pierces the morning calm—a distant gunshot. The group ducks instinctively, their eyes wide with alarm. The guide steers the boat towards the riverbank, looking for cover.

GUIDE 2
(subtitled, urgently)
We need to get off the river. Now.

They pull the boat ashore and quickly disembark, hiding it among the thick underbrush. The group moves into the jungle, their steps cautious as they put distance between themselves and the river.

EXT. JUNGLE - MORNING

The jungle is dense, the foliage thick and tangled. The group moves in single file, the guides clearing a path with their machetes. The air is heavy with humidity, sweat beading on their foreheads as they push forward.

Alice and Jackson stay close, their hands occasionally brushing against each other for reassurance. The sound of another gunshot, closer this time, hastens their pace.

JACKSON
(whispering to Alice)
We’re not alone out here. We need to be ready for anything.

ALICE
(whispering back)
I know. Keep everyone alert and watch the flanks.

The group continues, their senses heightened to every sound and movement in the jungle. After an hour of tense trekking, they come across an old, overgrown trail.

MOUNTAIN GUIDE
(subtitled)
This trail should lead us directly to the mining town. Stay sharp.

EXT. OLD MINING TOWN - NOON

The group emerges from the jungle onto the outskirts of the old mining town. The town is a ghost of its former self, the buildings dilapidated and overtaken by the jungle. They move cautiously through the deserted streets, alert for any signs of occupancy.

Alice leads them to a sturdy-looking building that appears to have been a supply store. Inside, they find old mining equipment, canned food, and other supplies. They quickly gather what they can use, mindful of the time.

JACKSON
(checking his watch)
We can’t stay long. We need to find a secure place to hold up and make plans.

As they prepare to leave the store, a sudden commotion outside catches their attention. They freeze, listening. Voices, harsh and commanding, drift in through the open windows. They’re not alone.

ALICE
(whispering)
Back door, now. Move quietly.

The group silently moves to the back of the store, exiting into an alley just as the front door bursts open. They hide behind some barrels, watching as a group of armed men enter the store they just left.

SCARRED MAN
(shouting)
Search the area! They can’t be far.

The realization that it’s the Scarred Man’s group sends a chill down Alice’s spine. They wait until the men disperse into the town, then make their way stealthily towards the edge of the town, avoiding the main streets.

EXT. EDGE OF MINING TOWN - AFTERNOON

The group reaches the jungle’s edge, pausing to catch their breath. Alice looks back at the town, her expression grim.

ALICE
(quietly)
We’re being hunted, and it’s only going to get worse. We need a plan, and we need it now.

Jackson nods, his face set in determination. The group gathers around, ready to discuss their next move, aware that every decision now could mean the difference between life and death. The adventure has taken a darker turn, but their resolve to protect the artifacts—and each other—has never been stronger.

EXT. EDGE OF MINING TOWN - AFTERNOON

The group huddles in the dense foliage just beyond the mining town, their faces etched with concern and fatigue. Alice pulls out a worn map, spreading it on the ground as everyone gathers around. The urgency of their situation hangs heavily in the air.

ALICE
(pointing at the map)
We need to head north. There’s an old research station here, abandoned for decades. It’s remote and should offer us some safety to regroup.

JACKSON
(looking over her shoulder)
It’s a long trek through tough terrain. We’ll need to move fast and light.

GUIDE 1
(subtitled)
The jungle is thick and full of dangers. We must be cautious but swift.

The group quickly agrees on the plan. They decide to leave behind anything non-essential and only carry what’s necessary for survival and protecting the artifacts.

EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON

With renewed determination, the group sets out through the dense jungle, their path marked by the relentless sounds of wildlife and the rustle of leaves underfoot. The guides lead, machetes in hand, clearing a path through the undergrowth.

As they trek, the canopy above thickens, casting deep shadows that turn the day eerily into night. The air is thick with humidity, making every breath and step a struggle.

Suddenly, a loud crack echoes through the jungle, followed by a shout. The group halts, turning to see one of their own, a young researcher named TOM, has fallen into a hidden pit. Panic ensues as they rush to the edge.

ALICE
(shouting)
Tom! Hold on, we’re getting you out!

The pit isn’t deep, but Tom is shaken, his leg injured. The guides quickly fashion a rope from vines, and with concerted effort, they pull Tom out. Once safe, the guide examines Tom’s leg.

GUIDE 2
(subtitled)
It’s sprained, not broken. He can walk, but not fast.

JACKSON
(concerned)
We’ll need to support him. Let’s rearrange the packs to lighten his load.

The group reorganizes, distributing Tom’s gear among them. They set off again, slower now, supporting Tom as they navigate through the increasingly challenging terrain.

EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

Night falls quickly in the jungle, and the group decides to set up a temporary camp. They are deep in the wilderness, far from any trails or signs of civilization. The darkness is complete, the sounds of the jungle both beautiful and terrifying.

As they sit around a small, carefully concealed fire, Alice speaks up, trying to bolster the group’s morale.

ALICE
(softly)
I know this is hard, and it’s not what any of us signed up for. But we’re doing something important. These artifacts... they could change how we understand history. We’re protecting that.

Her words have a calming effect, and the group shares a quiet moment, each lost in their thoughts about the journey and its meaning.

EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN

The group breaks camp at first light, eager to make up for lost time. The jungle seems less threatening in the morning light, but the dangers remain the same.

As they press on, navigating through thick vines and over slippery roots, a sudden, sharp cry of a wild animal close by reminds them of the precariousness of their situation. They freeze, scanning the surroundings.

GUIDE 1
(subtitled, whispering)
A jaguar. Keep calm and stay together.

The tension is palpable as they slowly back away from the sound, not wanting to threaten or provoke the unseen predator. After what feels like an eternity, they move on, the danger slowly receding but their nerves remaining on edge.

EXT. JUNGLE - LATE MORNING

Finally, after hours of tense trekking, the jungle begins to clear, and the old research station comes into view. It’s a dilapidated building, overtaken by vines and moss, but to the weary group, it looks like a fortress.

ALICE
(relieved)
We made it. Let’s secure the building and set up inside.

The group approaches the station cautiously, checking for any signs of recent activity or habitation. Finding none, they enter the building, setting about fortifying it and tending to their needs.

INT. OLD RESEARCH STATION - DAY

Inside, the station is musty and damp, but it provides much-needed shelter. The group sets up a central area for planning and divides the tasks of exploring the building and securing it.

As they settle in, Alice takes a moment to examine the artifacts, ensuring they are still safe. She looks up at her companions, her face set with resolve.

ALICE
(earnestly)
We’re not out of danger yet, but we’re in a better position now. Let’s use this time wisely. We need a solid plan to get these artifacts safely out of here.

The group nods in agreement, the weight of their responsibility clear but their determination renewed. They are together, they are safe for the moment, and they have a chance to make a difference. The adventure continues, fraught with danger but driven by a noble purpose.

INT. OLD RESEARCH STATION - DAY

The interior of the research station is a maze of old, dusty rooms filled with remnants of scientific endeavors long abandoned. The group spreads out to secure the perimeter and to find any resources that could be useful. Alice and Jackson take charge of setting up a central command area in what appears to have been the main lab.

The room is cluttered with old furniture and equipment. They clear a space, setting up a makeshift table with maps and the artifacts carefully laid out. The air is thick with the mustiness of disuse, but the sense of purpose energizes the group.

JACKSON
(organizing equipment)
We'll need to establish a watch rotation. We can't afford any surprises.

ALICE
(nodding)
Agreed. And we need to start thinking about our next move. We can't stay here indefinitely.

As they talk, TOM, limping slightly from his sprained ankle, and GUIDE 1 enter the room, carrying a dusty old radio they found in another part of the building.

TOM
(holding up the radio)
Look what we found. Think it still works?

JACKSON
(taking the radio)
Let's find out. It could be our ticket to calling for help.

Jackson fiddles with the radio, adjusting knobs and antennas. After a moment of static, the radio crackles to life, surprising everyone. They gather around, listening intently as Jackson tries to tune into any frequency that might be active.

JACKSON
(focused)
Come on... come on...

Suddenly, a voice breaks through the static, speaking in rapid Spanish. The group looks at GUIDE 2, who listens closely and then begins to translate.

GUIDE 2
(subtitled)
It’s a weather station. They’re talking about a storm system moving in.

ALICE
(concerned)
A storm could make things even more difficult for us. We need to secure the building against the elements and prepare for a potentially prolonged stay.

The group springs into action, reinforcing windows and checking the structural integrity of the building. As they work, the wind begins to pick up outside, the first signs of the approaching storm.

EXT. OLD RESEARCH STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

The sky darkens as clouds roll in, casting an ominous shadow over the jungle. The wind howls, whipping the trees into a frenzied dance. Inside, the group finishes their preparations just as the first drops of rain begin to fall.

INT. OLD RESEARCH STATION - NIGHT

The storm rages outside, the sound of heavy rain and wind almost deafening. The group is gathered in the main lab, the room lit by lanterns that cast flickering shadows on the walls. Despite the storm, there’s a sense of camaraderie as they share a meager meal of canned food and discuss their plans.

ALICE
(over the roar of the storm)
Once the storm passes, we’ll need to move quickly. We can use the cover of the bad weather to mask our departure.

JACKSON
(agreed)
We should head north. There’s a village about two days' trek from here. If we can reach it, we might be able to find a guide who can help us get these artifacts out safely.

GUIDE 1
(subtitled)
It’s risky. The terrain is difficult, and we don’t know what’s waiting for us out there.

ALICE
(determined)
It’s a risk we have to take. These artifacts... they’re too important. We’ve come too far to give up now.

The group nods, their faces set with resolve. They spend the rest of the night refining their plan, mapping out their route, and preparing for the challenges ahead.

As the storm continues to batter the building, they settle into their makeshift sleeping arrangements, the sound of the rain a constant companion. Despite the danger and the uncertainty, there’s a sense of purpose that binds them together, each member driven by the mission to protect and preserve a piece of history that has the power to change the world.

INT. OLD RESEARCH STATION - EARLY MORNING

The storm has passed, leaving the jungle soaked and dripping. The first light of dawn peeks through the broken windows, casting a soft glow on the weary but determined faces of the group. They gather their gear, checking and double-checking their packs, ensuring the artifacts are securely wrapped and protected from the elements.

ALICE
(adjusting her backpack)
Everyone ready? Remember, stay alert and keep close. We can’t afford to get separated.

JACKSON
(nodding)
Let’s move out. Guide 1, you take point. Guide 2, bring up the rear.

The group nods in agreement, their faces set with determination. They move out, leaving the safety of the old research station behind as they venture into the dense, wet jungle.

EXT. JUNGLE - MORNING

The jungle is alive with the sounds of wildlife, the air fresh and crisp after the storm. The ground is muddy, making the trek difficult and treacherous. The group moves in a tight formation, their eyes scanning the lush greenery for any sign of danger.

As they push through the underbrush, a sudden rustling to their left causes them to stop abruptly. They watch as a large capybara scurries away, its presence a reminder of the jungle’s many inhabitants.

GUIDE 1
(subtitled, pointing ahead)
The terrain will get rougher as we approach the northern ridge. Watch your footing.

The group continues, their pace steady but cautious. The jungle slowly begins to thin as they approach higher ground, the trees giving way to rocky outcrops and sparse vegetation.

EXT. NORTHERN RIDGE - NOON

The group reaches the northern ridge by midday, the sun high in the sky casting harsh shadows on the rugged terrain. They pause to rest, taking in the view of the valley below, a tapestry of greens and browns stretching out as far as the eye can see.

ALICE
(taking a deep breath)
We’re making good time. Let’s eat something and then keep moving. We need to reach the village by tomorrow evening.

They share a quick meal of energy bars and dried fruit, conserving their water and resources. As they prepare to set off again, a distant sound catches their attention—a faint but distinct hum, like that of an engine.

JACKSON
(listening intently)
Helicopter. It could be searching for us. We need to stay out of sight.

The group quickly packs up and moves off the ridge, seeking cover in a nearby thicket. They watch as a helicopter passes overhead, flying low over the valley. The tension is palpable, each member of the group aware of how close they came to being discovered.

EXT. THICKET - AFTERNOON

The helicopter moves on, and the group leaves their hiding spot, continuing their trek with renewed urgency. The landscape becomes more challenging, the rocky ground interspersed with dense patches of brush.

As they navigate a particularly steep incline, TOM, still hampered by his injured leg, slips and falls. The group rushes to his aid, helping him up.

TOM
(grimacing)
I’m okay. Just a slip.

ALICE
(concerned)
We can’t push you too hard. Let’s slow the pace a bit.

The group adjusts, supporting Tom as they make their way down the other side of the ridge. The sun begins to set, casting long shadows over the landscape.

EXT. JUNGLE CAMP - NIGHT

The group sets up camp for the night in a small clearing, exhausted but safe. They take turns keeping watch, the events of the day weighing heavily on their minds.

Around the campfire, Alice and Jackson discuss their next moves, the flickering flames casting a warm glow on their faces.

ALICE
(softly)
Once we reach the village, we’ll need to find a guide quickly and figure out the safest way to transport the artifacts.

JACKSON
(nodding)
We’re close, Alice. I can feel it. We just need to stay focused and keep moving forward.

The group settles in for the night, the sounds of the jungle a constant backdrop to their vigilance. Despite the challenges and dangers they’ve faced, their resolve remains unbroken, each member driven by the mission that has brought them together. As they drift off to sleep, the promise of reaching the village and securing the artifacts gives them hope, fueling their determination to see this adventure through to the end.

EXT. JUNGLE CAMP - EARLY MORNING

The camp stirs as the first light of dawn breaks through the dense canopy. The group, visibly tired but determined, quickly dismantles their temporary shelter. They eat a sparse breakfast while reviewing their plan for the day. The goal is clear: reach the village by nightfall.

ALICE
(checking the map)
The terrain will get easier as we move downhill towards the river. Once we cross it, the village is only a few hours away.

JACKSON
(loading his pack)
Let’s make sure we’re all ready to move out. No stragglers, and keep your eyes peeled. We’re not out of the woods yet—figuratively and literally.

The group sets out, their pace brisk. The jungle around them is alive with the sounds of morning; birds chirping and insects buzzing create a natural symphony.

EXT. JUNGLE - MORNING

As they trek, the dense jungle gradually gives way to a more open landscape. The sound of running water becomes audible, signaling their approach to the river. The relief on their faces is palpable; crossing the river would mark a significant milestone in their journey.

GUIDE 1
(subtitled, pointing ahead)
The river is just through this clearing. We need to be careful; the banks can be slippery.

The group reaches the riverbank, the water flowing swiftly. It’s wider than they anticipated, and the current looks strong. They scout along the bank for a safer place to cross.

TOM
(looking worried)
That current looks strong. Are we sure about this?

ALICE
(assessing the situation)
We don’t have much choice. But let’s not take any unnecessary risks. We’ll use ropes to secure each other as we cross.

The guides quickly set to work, securing ropes around sturdy trees on either side of the river. One by one, the group crosses, the water rushing around them. It’s a tense process, but eventually, everyone makes it to the other side safely.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

Once across, the group takes a short break to catch their breath and dry off. The sun is now high in the sky, its warmth a welcome relief after the cold water.

JACKSON
(checking his watch)
We need to keep moving if we want to reach the village before dark.

The terrain becomes easier, and the group picks up the pace. The anticipation of reaching the village and potentially finding help seems to energize them.

EXT. APPROACH TO VILLAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

As the sun begins to set, casting long shadows over the land, the group finally sees signs of civilization. A small path lined with handmade fences and scattered livestock marks the outskirts of the village.

ALICE
(relieved)
Finally. Let’s try to find the village elder or someone who can help us.

They enter the village, greeted by curious stares from the locals. Children run alongside them, laughing and pointing, while adults watch cautiously from their doorways.

EXT. VILLAGE CENTER - EVENING

The group is led to the village center, where an elderly man, clearly a figure of authority, sits surrounded by other villagers. Alice steps forward, explaining their situation with the help of Guide 2, who translates.

ALICE
(to the elder, through Guide 2)
We’re researchers, and we’ve come a long way. We need help to secure passage out of the jungle with some important historical artifacts.

The village elder listens intently, nodding occasionally. After a brief discussion with his advisors, he responds.

VILLAGE ELDER
(subtitled)
We can help, but it will take some time to arrange for safe passage. You can stay here as our guests until then.

ALICE
(grateful)
Thank you. We appreciate your hospitality and your help.

The group is shown to a couple of simple huts where they can rest. As night falls, the village comes alive with the sounds of evening activities. Despite the exhaustion and the lingering tension of their journey, there’s a sense of relief among the group. They have made it this far, and for the moment, they are safe. They gather outside their huts, watching the stars appear in the night sky, their conversation light and hopeful for the first time in days.

JACKSON
(looking at the stars)
Tomorrow, we’ll figure out the next steps. For tonight, let’s just take a moment to breathe.

The group agrees, settling into the peace of the village, the night’s calm a stark contrast to the perils they have faced. They know challenges lie ahead, but for now, they rest, the weight of their responsibility momentarily lifted.

INT. VILLAGE HUT - EARLY MORNING

The first light of dawn filters through the simple woven walls of the hut. The group is already awake, gathered around a small wooden table where a map is spread out. They discuss their plan in hushed tones, aware of the importance of the day ahead.

ALICE
(looking determined)
Once we secure transportation, we need to head straight to the nearest city. From there, we can arrange for the artifacts to be safely transported to the university.

JACKSON
(nodding)
I’ll talk to the elder again this morning. Hopefully, he’s managed to arrange something on such short notice.

GUIDE 1
(subtitled)
The people here are wary of outsiders. Trust must be earned.

Alice nods, understanding the delicate balance they need to maintain to ensure the cooperation of the villagers.

EXT. VILLAGE CENTER - MORNING

The village is bustling with activity as the locals begin their day. Jackson approaches the elder, who is overseeing a group of young men preparing a cart. The elder greets Jackson warmly, sensing the urgency of their need.

VILLAGE ELDER
(subtitled)
We have prepared a cart for your journey. It will take you to the city, but the road is rough and long. You must be careful.

JACKSON
(grateful)
Thank you. We appreciate all your help.

Jackson returns to the group, who are packing their belongings and securing the artifacts in portable, padded cases.

ALICE
(relieved)
That’s one less thing to worry about. Let’s make sure everything is secure. We can’t afford any damage.

EXT. VILLAGE - LATE MORNING

The group, now ready to depart, gathers their gear and heads to the cart. The villagers watch, a mix of curiosity and concern on their faces. The children wave, having grown fond of the strangers over the brief stay.

The cart, drawn by two sturdy oxen, is loaded with their equipment. The group climbs aboard, settling in for the long journey ahead. The elder comes forward, handing Alice a small, wrapped bundle.

VILLAGE ELDER
(subtitled)
A token for safe travels. Keep it with you.

Alice accepts the gift, touched by the gesture. She unwraps it to find a small, intricately carved figurine, which she carefully places in her pocket.

ALICE
(to the elder, through Guide 2)
Thank you for everything. We won’t forget your kindness.

The cart begins to move, pulling away from the village. The group waves goodbye, their faces a mix of relief and apprehension as they face the next leg of their journey.

EXT. RUGGED PATH - DAY

The path out of the village is uneven and fraught with obstacles. The cart jostles and creaks under the strain, but the oxen plod steadily forward. The jungle looms on either side, a constant reminder of the wildness that surrounds them.

As they travel, the group discusses their strategy for when they reach the city. They need to contact their university sponsor and arrange for the secure transport of the artifacts. The weight of their responsibility is palpable, each member of the group aware of the historical significance of their cargo.

JACKSON
(checking his GPS device)
We should reach the outskirts of the city by tomorrow morning if we keep this pace.

TOM
(looking at the artifacts)
It’s hard to believe something so small can be so important.

ALICE
(seriously)
It’s not just the artifacts themselves—it’s what they represent. History, knowledge, a connection to the past. We’re just the custodians.

The path begins to widen as they approach more civilized areas. The dense jungle gives way to scattered farms and small settlements. The presence of more frequent human activity is a stark contrast to the isolation of the jungle.

EXT. RURAL OUTSKIRTS - SUNSET

The sun sets as they approach the outskirts of the city. The sky turns a brilliant orange, casting long shadows across the path. The group is weary but vigilant, knowing that the most critical part of their journey is yet to come.

The cart rolls to a stop for the night beside a small, clear stream. The group sets up a temporary camp, their routine now familiar and efficient. As they eat their evening meal, the city's distant lights flicker on the horizon, a beacon of the modern world so close yet still out of reach.

ALICE
(looking towards the city)
Tomorrow, everything changes. Let’s get some rest. We’ll need all our strength.

The group settles in, the sounds of the night a comforting blanket around them. They are close to achieving their goal, each member of the team aware of the stakes. As they drift off to sleep, the city’s glow on the horizon promises a new day and new challenges.

EXT. RURAL OUTSKIRTS - EARLY MORNING

The first light of dawn casts a soft glow over the makeshift camp. The group is already stirring, packing up their belongings with a practiced efficiency. The city is only a few hours away, and the anticipation is palpable.

ALICE
(checking her watch)
We need to be on the move at first light. The sooner we get these artifacts secured, the better.

JACKSON
(agreed)
I’ll make sure the cart is ready. We can’t afford any delays today.

The group finishes their quick breakfast and loads the last of their gear onto the cart. The oxen are hitched and ready, their breath visible in the cool morning air.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - MORNING

The cart moves along the increasingly busy road. Farmers and traders are beginning their day, carts and bicycles laden with goods heading towards the city. The group keeps a low profile, mindful of the precious cargo they carry.

As they approach the city outskirts, the traffic thickens, a mix of modern vehicles and traditional carts creating a slow-moving chaos. The group is tense, aware that they are now more vulnerable to theft or interference.

INT. CART - MORNING

The group huddles in the cart, the city’s sprawling outskirts passing by. Alice checks the artifacts, ensuring they are still securely packed.

ALICE
(to Jackson)
Once we get to the university, we’ll need to verify the security arrangements. I don’t want these out of our sight until they’re locked down.

JACKSON
(nodding)
I’ve already sent word ahead. They should be expecting us.

EXT. CITY STREETS - LATE MORNING

The cart finally enters the city, the bustling streets a stark contrast to the quiet of the jungle. Horns honk, and vendors shout, the sounds of urban life enveloping them. The university is not far now, and the group navigates through the traffic with growing urgency.

EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - NOON

The cart pulls up to the university, a modern building amidst the chaos of the city. Security guards approach immediately, ushered by a well-dressed man who introduces himself as DR. MARTINEZ, the university liaison.

DR. MARTINEZ
(shaking hands with Alice)
Welcome. We’ve been expecting you. If you’ll follow me, we have everything prepared.

The group follows Dr. Martinez into the building, relief washing over them as they enter the secure facility.

INT. UNIVERSITY LAB - AFTERNOON

The artifacts are carefully unloaded and brought into a high-tech lab, where they are placed on secure, cushioned tables. Dr. Martinez oversees the process, ensuring that each piece is handled with care.
