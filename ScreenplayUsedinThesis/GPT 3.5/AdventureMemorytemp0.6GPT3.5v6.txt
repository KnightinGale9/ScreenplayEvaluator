INT. JUNGLE - DAY

The dense jungle canopy filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. The air is thick with humidity, and the sounds of exotic birds and insects fill the air. A group of explorers, dressed in rugged gear and armed with machetes, trudge through the undergrowth, pushing their way through the thick foliage.

LEADER
(looking at a map)
According to the coordinates, the temple should be just ahead. Keep your eyes peeled for any signs of ancient ruins.

The group moves cautiously, their boots squelching in the mud as they navigate through the dense vegetation. Suddenly, they stumble upon a clearing, and before them looms a massive stone temple, covered in vines and moss. The intricate carvings on the walls hint at a long-forgotten civilization.

EXPLORER #1
(whispering)
This place gives me the creeps. Who knows what kind of dangers lurk within those walls?

LEADER
(sternly)
Stay sharp, everyone. We don't know what we might find in there. Let's stick together and proceed with caution.

They enter the temple, the air growing cooler as they step inside. The interior is dimly lit, shafts of sunlight streaming in through cracks in the ceiling. The sound of their footsteps echoes off the ancient stone walls as they make their way deeper into the temple.

EXPLORER #2
(pointing to a mural)

LEADER
(taking the amulet in hand)
This is fascinating. It appears to be a symbol of great importance to the ancient civilization that once inhabited this temple. We must study it further to unlock its secrets.

As they continue their exploration, a low rumbling sound fills the chamber, causing the explorers to exchange concerned glances. The ground beneath their feet begins to tremble, and cracks appear in the walls, sending dust and debris raining down around them.

EXPLORER #2
(voice filled with alarm)
We need to get out of here! The temple is collapsing!

LEADER
(urgent)
Quickly, gather what you can and make for the exit. We must get out of here before it's too late.

The explorers scramble to gather as many artifacts as they can carry, their hearts pounding with adrenaline as they race towards the entrance of the temple. The ground shakes violently, and the walls begin to crumble around them, threatening to trap them inside.

LEADER
(yelling over the chaos)
Move, move! We're running out of time!

With a final burst of speed, the explorers reach the entrance of the temple and burst out into the blinding sunlight, their arms laden with treasures. Behind them, the temple collapses in on itself, the ancient stones crumbling to dust as the ground swallows it whole.

The explorers stand in the clearing, catching their breath as they watch the temple vanish from sight, a sense of awe and accomplishment washing over them. But as they gaze at the ruins, a shadow falls across the clearing, and they realize that their adventure is far from over.

INT. CLEARING OUTSIDE TEMPLE - DAY

The explorers stand in the clearing, their breath coming in ragged gasps as they watch the temple collapse in on itself, the ancient stones crumbling to dust before their eyes. The air is thick with dust and debris, the sound of falling rocks echoing through the jungle.

LEADER
(panting)
That was too close. We're lucky to have made it out in time.

EXPLORER #1
(voice filled with awe)
I can't believe it's gone. All that history, lost in an instant.

Despite the destruction of the temple, the explorers cling to the treasures they salvaged, their hands clutching the artifacts tightly as if afraid they might disappear. The weight of their discoveries hangs heavy on their shoulders, a mix of triumph and sorrow in their hearts.

LEADER
(voice filled with determination)
We may have lost the temple, but we still have these artifacts. Our journey is far from over. We must find out more about the civilization that built that temple and the significance of these treasures.

As they regroup and catch their breath, a sudden rustling in the underbrush catches their attention. The explorers tense, their hands instinctively reaching for their weapons as a figure emerges from the foliage - a mysterious woman, dressed in tattered clothing and adorned with tribal jewelry.

MYSTERY WOMAN
(voice tinged with caution)
You have trespassed on sacred ground. The temple's collapse was a warning - you must leave this place at once.

LEADER
(stepping forward)
We mean no harm. We are explorers, seeking to uncover the secrets of this ancient civilization. Can you help us?
